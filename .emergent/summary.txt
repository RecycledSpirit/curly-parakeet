The previous AI engineer (Neo) successfully bootstrapped the CraveKind application from conception to a near-beta state. Initially, Neo focused on a comprehensive frontend-only implementation with mock data to achieve an early aha moment, incorporating detailed user requirements like color schemes, gamification, and rich content. Upon user approval, Neo pivoted to backend development, establishing MongoDB models and services for core functionalities. Throughout the process, Neo actively addressed user feedback, including rebranding, logo adjustments, data accuracy, and user experience enhancements. A significant effort was dedicated to expanding the vegan alternatives database and initiating CRM functionalities. The work is currently focused on refining frontend elements and preparing for backend integration and deployment, addressing a detailed list of user-identified issues.

<product_requirements>
The user requested an application, named CraveKind, and a landing page that provides vegan alternatives for specific meat cravings, explains the nutritional deficiencies causing the cravings, and offers brand recommendations. Key features include: saving favorite alternatives, detailed nutritional comparisons (plant-based vs. meat, long-term benefits/side-effects), meal recipe suggestions (with step-by-step instructions and seasoning), and an extensive database of meat dishes/alternatives. The design should utilize an earthy green and beige color scheme with modern UI/UX principles (animations, depth, bold typography, asymmetrical layouts). Gamification with achievement badges, progress tracking, user stats, and a leveling system featuring cute animal thank-you messages and real environmental impact calculations (CO2 saved, animals spared) is crucial. A Contact Us page with a form (forwarding to ) and a Coming Soon page for a community feature with email signup are needed. User authentication and a built-in CRM for contact management and email tracking are also required. The application needs to be deployable as a web app on  and later as a React Native mobile app for iOS and Android.

**Key Files and Changes:**

*   : This file replaced  and . It now holds the extensive 84-item vegan alternatives database provided by the user, covering 10 categories of meat dishes. It's crucial for the app's core search functionality, containing detailed nutritional info, brand recommendations, recipes, and deficiency explanations.
*   : The main entry point for the React application. It manages routing (using React Router DOM) and integrates the overall application structure. Changes included integrating the  component, navigation updates, and dynamic content adjustments based on user feedback.
*   : Contains the hero section, testimonials, stats, features, and calls-to-action. It has undergone multiple content and design updates, including rebranding to CraveKind, removing misleading stats, integrating the new logo, and updating copy for feature boxes.
*   : Implements the core search functionality. It was updated to utilize the  data for expanded search results and to display environmental impact and gamification elements.
*   : A newly added page that includes a form for users to submit inquiries (First Name, Last Name, Email, Message). It is designed to send emails to  and store messages in the backend CRM database.
*   : A new component created to manage the application's logo, which has undergone several iterations to match the user's green heart with leaves sprouting from top description.
*   : A newly created component to display legal disclaimers about the app's content being for educational purposes only and advising users to consult healthcare professionals.
*   : This file was introduced to define the levels, animal characters, thank-you messages, and progression logic for the gamification feature.
*   : A new component displaying the animal friends and their thank you messages as part of the gamification feature.
*   : A new component to display dynamically calculated environmental savings (CO2, water, land, animals spared) based on user activity.
*   : A newly created backend model to define the structure for storing CRM contact information, aligning with the simplified built-in CRM approach.
*   : A new backend route file added to handle the contact form submissions, including saving to the database and sending emails.
*   : A new backend route file that provides endpoints for an admin dashboard, intended for managing contacts and viewing CRM statistics.
*   : The main FastAPI application file. It was updated to include the new API routers (, ) and integrate the new models and services.
*   : Updated to , though actual domain connection requires external DNS setup.

The structure is set up for modularity, separating components, pages, data, contexts, and hooks on the frontend, and models, routes, and services on the backend.

<current_work>
The immediate work is to address the 10 specific issues identified by the user after their recent testing of the frontend:
1.  **Contact form functionality**: The form currently displays an error message and does not send emails as expected. The backend setup for this, including  routes and email sending logic, has been initiated, and the AI engineer confirmed it's supposed to send to  and store in DB. However, there is a runtime issue.
2.  **Unclickable CTAs**: Features and Resources links in the footer are not clickable.
3.  **Business inquiries link**: The link for  currently opens Outlook, which is undesired. It should simply display the email address or open a mailto link without forcing Outlook.
4.  **Privacy policy and terms of service**: These links are not clickable.
5.  **Content updates on Landing Page**: Specific text changes are required for the main statistics (Help replace 2.5 million meals...), the intro line under Why choose CraveKind, and the headers/text for Understand Your Cravings, Swap Smarter, and Recipe Inspiration sections.
6.  **Database Expansion (Yam for Fish)**: User provided a new suggestion for yam as a fish alternative.
7.  **Shrimp search issue**: Despite the comprehensive database, shrimp search yields no results, indicating a search logic or data mapping issue.
8.  **Recipe detail**: Recipes currently lack sufficient detail (only ingredients and one-line instructions), requiring more comprehensive, step-by-step instructions including seasoning.
9.  **Coming Soon page**: A coming soon page for the community feature is needed, including an email ID capture box for invitations.
10. **Backend Completion**: After these frontend and data issues are resolved, the user wants to proceed with completing the backend, setting up hosting, configuring the domain, and deploying for beta testing.

The AI engineer has begun addressing these points, starting with  edits (as per Chat Message 119 and 121), indicating a start on the frontend/routing related fixes.
